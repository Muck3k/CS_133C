DESIGN 

I realize that all of my design was wrong to start with but I think that 

it helped me code a program even better than the assignment. Next time I 

will for sure read the assignment notes a couple more times before designing. 

  

TESTING 

Most of my tests are commented in the code. I did have a little bit of trouble 

getting the winner to print out correctly. I understand now that I didn't 

even need to go to that extent but I did it anyway. 

  

REFLECTION 

This week was good practice for while loops and if statements. Also, it was 

an introduction into the scanf function. This week was a very productive week. 

I'm starting to realize more and more how important design really is. I tend 

to just jump in and start coding. This was how I learned to code in the first 

place. It's a bad habit, but I think this class will help me learn the design 

side of coding.
