1.1 The project portion is telling me to store a few different variables and then
test a couple of them using the printf function.

1.2 I believe that the lessons for this week were for us to learn the different
data types in C, use and test the printf function, and undertand how to design
a program before coding it.

1.3 All the testing can be seen in my code with the printf lines. I ran into a
couple problems trying to print values, but I found out that there are certain
specifiers that needed to be declared after a % sign for it to know what value
to print.

1.4.1 I ran into a coupole of problems as stated above, but they were answered 
during the second class section.
1.4.2 I wish I knew more C. This is the first time that I have ever coded in C.
1.4.3 My tests were the printf lines. I couldn't figure out how to print out
a float rather than a bloolean.
1.4.4 Trying to print different values was a struggle.
1.4.5 I'm not sure.
1.4.6 Class helped me a lot for this assignment. Especially because I knew nothing
about C.
1.4.7 Yes. I'm sure I'll be using variables and printf in every future project.

2.10.1 I believe a source file is a file that holds a program's source code.
2.10.2 An exexutable is a file that can be ran by the computer. It's in binary, so
that the computer can process it.
2.10.3 A process is a sequence of commands.
2.10.4 I'm honestly not sure.
2.10.5 So that we can learn about source code, and understand how our programs run.
